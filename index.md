[Dominion](https://github.com/dominion-dev/dominion-ecs-java) is an [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) library for Java

## Features

- 🚀 **_FAST_** : Dominion is not only an insanely fast ECS for the Java platform, it can also be in the same league as
  ECS for C/C++ (see [benchmarks](https://github.com/dominion-dev/dominion-ecs-java-benchmark))
- 🤏 **_TINY_** : just a high-performance Core Java library with a minimal footprint and no dependencies. So you can
  easily integrate Dominion into your game engine or framework or use it directly for your game or application.
- ☕️ **_SIMPLE_** : Dominion aims to be simple by design and exposes a clean, minimal, and self-explanatory API. This
  readme alone will provide a complete usage documentation
- 💪 **_with SUPPORT_** : [join the Discord!](https://discord.gg/BHMz3axqUG) The server will support users and announce
  the availability of the new version.

Dominion is still in early stages 🍼. The API is not yet complete and not fully implemented, but every part already
built comes with unit tests and benchmarks. There are currently no releases yet and first release is scheduled for the
first quarter of 2022.
